Theme transfer instructions
---------------------------

Elgg 0.4 has a radically different theme structure than the previous 
version.  By default, previous themes will be deleted, as they no
longer work with the system and may cause problems.  Documentation on
developing themes is available at http://elgg.org/; these are now
based on standard CSS and should be significantly easier to create
and share.

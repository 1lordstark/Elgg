Theme transfer instructions
---------------------------

Elgg 0.3x has a radically different navigation and theme structure
than the previous version. As a result, themes from previous versions
will not work, and by default old themes are deleted on upgrade.
However, if you would like to use old themes, you can perform the
following actions using the theme editor:


A. 'CONTENT HOLDER':

1. Copy the contents of infobox into contentholder
2. Change {{name}} to {{title}}, {{content}} to {{body}}
3. Add {{submenu}} just above {{body}}

B. 'PAGE SHELL':

1. In pageshell, add {{topmenu}} directly after {{menu}}

C. 'SELECTED INDIVIDUAL MAIN MENU ITEM':

1. Copy 'individual main menu item' to 'SELECTED individual menu item'

D. 'STATUS MENUBAR SHELL':

1. Copy 'main menu shell' to 'status menubar shell'
2. Replace {{menuitems}} in the status menubar shell with {{topmenuitems}}
3. Copy 'individual main menu item' to 'individual status menu item'

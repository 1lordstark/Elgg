Each shared hosting provider prepends the account holder's name to the databases associated with that account. For example, the username for our primary host is ``userx`` so the host will prepend ``userx_`` to give us a database name of ``userx_elgg``. When we restore to our second shared hosting provider we're doing so with a username of ``usery`` so our database name will be ``usery_elgg``. The hosting providers don't allow you to modify this behavior. So the process here isn't as simple as just restoring the database from backup to the usery account.

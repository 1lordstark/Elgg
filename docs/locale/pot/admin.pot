Each shared hosting provider prepends the account holder's name to the databases associated with that account. For example, the username for our primary host is ``userx`` so the host will prepend ``userx_`` to give us a database name of ``userx_elgg``. When we restore to our second shared hosting provider we're doing so with a username of ``usery`` so our database name will be ``usery_elgg``. The hosting providers don't allow you to modify this behavior. So the process here isn't as simple as just restoring the database from backup to the usery account.

msgid "In versions 1.9 and 1.10, names and values for metadata and annotations were not correctly trimmed for whitespace. Elgg 1.11 correctly trims these strings and updates the database to correct existing strings. If your plugin uses metadata or annotations with leading or trailing whitespace, you will need to update the plugin to trim the names and values. This is especially important if you are using custom SQL clauses or have hard-coded metastring IDs, since the update might change metastring IDs."

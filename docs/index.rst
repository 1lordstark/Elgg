Elgg Documentation
##################

This is the canonical developer documentation for the
`Elgg <http://elgg.org/>`_ project.

This aims to replace the `wiki <http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_,
which is out-of-date in many areas, but may still be of use to you.

Elgg (`pronounced /ˈɛlɡ/ <http://docs.elgg.org/w/images/4/42/How_to_say_Elgg.mp3>`_]) is a social networking framework. It provides the necessary functionality to allow you to run your own social networking site. Elgg has been used to build all different kinds of social sites:

 * general public (like Facebook)
 * intranet (like Sharepoint).
 * dating
 * educational 

There is also a `demo site <http://demo.elgg.org>`_ running a standard installation of Elgg.

The name comes from `a town in Switzerland <http://www.elgg.ch/de/>`_. It also means “elk” or "moose" in Danish.
